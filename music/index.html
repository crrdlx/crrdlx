LYRICS<br>
[Verse 1 - Man]<br>
The cargo deep within her hold<br>
Lake waves grow fierce this bitter night<br>
November tenth, the storm takes hold<br>
I strain to see the beacon's light<br>
[Verse 2 - Woman]<br>
November tenth, I watch and wait<br>
Our children rest in peaceful sleep<br>
I search beyond the harbor gate<br>
Your ship upon these waters deep<br>
[Chorus - Man]<br>
Ring the bell for twenty-nine<br>
(Woman: Let the deep bells sound)<br>
For the Edmund Fitzgerald's line<br>
(Woman: And all souls outward bound)<br>
For all who sailed and did not return<br>
For all who wait in prayer<br>
Let the bell's song ever burn<br>
As we remember them with care<br>
[Verse 3 - Man]<br>
No word comes through the radio<br>
The ship's steel heart moans in the gale<br>
These waters fierce, these waters cold<br>
Against the wind, we forge our trail<br>
[Verse 4 - Woman]<br>
I stand beside the window pane<br>
Where endless waves stretch far and wide<br>
Some bonds endure through wind and rain<br>
Some love runs deeper than the tide<br>
[Chorus - Man]<br>
Ring the bell for twenty-nine<br>
(Woman: Through the darkness sound)<br>
For the Edmund Fitzgerald's line<br>
(Woman: And every sailor found)<br>
For all who sailed and did not return<br>
For all who wait in prayer<br>
Let the bell's song ever burn<br>
As we remember them with care<br>
[Bridge - Man]<br>
The waves rise high<br>
[Bridge - Woman]<br>
The night grows long<br>
[Bridge - Both]<br>
The water knows our prayer<br>
The water bears us home<br>
[Chorus - Both, softly]<br>
Ring the bell for twenty-nine<br>
Let the deep bells sound<br>
For the Edmund Fitzgerald's line<br>
And all souls outward bound<br>
For all who sailed and did not return<br>
For all who wait in prayer<br>
Let the bell's song ever burn<br>
As we remember them with care<br>
[Outro - Woman]<br>
Year by year, the bell still rings<br>
For those who sailed beneath the stars<br>
For those who keep the watch today<br>
[Outro - Man]<br>
For those who wait<br>
[Outro - Both]<br>
And pray<br>
[Final lines - Both]<br>
Rest gentle now beneath the waves<br>
While we remember all your days<br>
As memories of you remain<br>

LYRICS<br>
November tenth, they set out at dawn<br>
The Edmund Fitzgerald, before she was gone<br>
Twenty-nine men on a freighter's deck<br>
Their final journey, we won't forget<br>
Verse 2<br>
<br>
The captain stood at the wheel that night<br>
Superior roared with all her might<br>
He'd seen rough water, he'd seen it calm<br>
But this was different, this was wrong<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
And the waves rise up like mountains tall<br>
And the brave men answer when the deep water calls<br>
We remember them, every soul so dear<br>
Forever sailing through the years<br>
(Through the years)<br>
(We remember)<br>
Verse 3<br>
<br>
He radioed in, said they were taking on<br>
The storm came fast, then the lights were gone<br>
Some say she broke, some say she rolled<br>
All we know is the water's cold<br>
Verse 4<br>
<br>
They were fathers, brothers, working men<br>
Doing their job till the very end<br>
The captain knew when he set that course<br>
Some things you can't turn back from, by force<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
And the waves rise up like mountains tall<br>
And the brave men answer when the deep water calls<br>
We remember them, every soul so dear<br>
Forever sailing through the years<br>
(Through the years)<br>
(We remember)<br>
Bridge<br>
<br>
For every sailor who won't come home<br>
For every vessel out there alone<br>
From the Great Lakes down to the ocean wide<br>
We keep your memory, we keep your pride<br>
Verse 5<br>
<br>
Each November tenth, we bow our heads<br>
For the living and for the dead<br>
The lake still holds what she took that day<br>
But their names won't wash away<br>
Final Chorus<br>
<br>
And the waves rise up like mountains tall<br>
And the brave men answer when the deep water calls<br>
We remember them, every soul so dear<br>
Forever sailing through the years<br>
(We remember them)<br>
(Every one)<br>
(Through the years)<br>
Outro<br>
<br>
November tenth, year after year<br>
We gather here to hold them dear<br>
Rest easy, captain, rest easy, crew<br>
The watch is ours, we'll see it through

LYRICS<br>
Acoustic guitar intro<br>
Verse 1<br>
<br>
I'm still here beneath the surface<br>
Where the cold runs through my bones<br>
Twenty-nine souls went silent<br>
When Superior claimed her own<br>
I can feel the water rising<br>
Like it happened yesterday<br>
November wind still howling<br>
Won't let the memory fade away<br>
Pre-Chorus<br>
<br>
We were fighting through the darkness<br>
We were holding to the rail<br>
Brotherhood was all we carried<br>
When the storm began to wail<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
Remember November ten<br>
When the lake took the bravest men<br>
Every sailor knows the price<br>
Out there on the edge of sacrifice<br>
So we honor those who fell<br>
In the deep where heroes dwell<br>
Ring the bell for them tonight<br>
Remember November ten<br>
Verse 2<br>
<br>
I've watched a thousand sunsets<br>
Paint the water red and gold<br>
Every ship that passes over<br>
Carries stories never told<br>
There's a weight in every voyage<br>
There's a risk in every run<br>
But we answer to the calling<br>
Till our final race is done<br>
Pre-Chorus<br>
<br>
We were brothers to each other<br>
We were faithful to the end<br>
Now I'm waiting in the water<br>
For the day we sail again<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
Remember November ten<br>
When the lake took the bravest men<br>
Every sailor knows the price<br>
Out there on the edge of sacrifice<br>
So we honor those who fell<br>
In the deep where heroes dwell<br>
Ring the bell for them tonight<br>
Remember November ten<br>
Bridge<br>
<br>
Stand at the shore<br>
Raise your hand to the sky<br>
Ring the bell once more<br>
Keep the vigil alive<br>
We're not just ghosts in the waves<br>
We were living, we were brave<br>
And we're still here<br>
Chorus<br>
Remember November ten<br>
When the lake took the bravest men<br>
Every sailor knows the price<br>
Out there on the edge of sacrifice<br>
So we honor those who fell<br>
In the deep where heroes dwell<br>
Light a flame that won't grow dim<br>
Remember November ten<br>
Outro<br>
<br>
Remember November ten<br>
(Remember November ten)<br>
Remember November ten<br>
